2.How do rental prices for each category differ by location (e.g., city, state)?									
3.Do certain amenities (e.g., parking, pet-friendly policies) have a different impact on pricing									
4.How does the size of the apartment correlate with the rental price?									
5.How do rental prices change over time (if date information is available)?									

## Data Analysis
Present the key analyses performed, including:
Price comparisons by location.
Correlation analysis between size and price.
Any clustering or segmentation performed.

## Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

The price of the apartments have been steadily increasing during the 22-25th December, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
Larger apartments and those with additional amenities (such as parking and pet-friendliness) were priced higher.
Prices varied significantly by region, with metropolitan areas showing higher increases compared to rural locations. For instance, cities like New York and San Francisco experienced price surges of over 15% during this time, while smaller towns saw a modest increase of around 5%.

## Recommendations
Increase rental prices during peak times, like the holiday season, to maximize income.
Make sure to showcase important apartment features (size, location, amenities) in listings to attract renters.
Consider adding amenities like gyms or laundry facilities to make the apartments more appealing.
